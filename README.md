# photographerApp

*** DESCRIPTION ***

there are articles titled "the 10 apps every street photographer needs" which include camera apps, light meters, editing apps, maps,weather, etc. there are things like instagram where you can take the photo and edit and post all in one place. but there is no single site/app to help photographers NAVIGATE the act of photography.

I want to build an app/site where photographers can enter their location and get local weather, maps, events/calendar, and maybe eventually add a feature where people can mark favorite places/easter eggs. this would not be another flickr or instagram. this would be like the boyscout app for photographers to have a successful experience in a city so they can focus on using their actual cameras to make their art

*** DEVELOPEMENT ***

Step 1 - GA Project 1 portion

• design home page - nav?, clickable boxes (one each for weather, maps, city calendar, comments. only the wweather button will be connected)
• create search bar that takes entered location, connects to weather api
• when the weather button is clicked, it is a modal that "fills" the screen and shows a window of the local weather
